# FaceMosaic

**FaceMosaic** is a cutting-edge facial recognition project that enables users to identify celebrity likenesses in images. By leveraging advanced facial encoding techniques, this project serves as a powerful tool for both celebrity matching and deepfake verification in today’s digital landscape. 🎉

## Features 🌟

- **Celebrity Matching**: Effortlessly identify and match faces with a curated dataset of celebrities, transforming the way users interact with images. This feature allows users to see their likenesses alongside their favorite stars, creating a fun and engaging experience. 🌟

- **Deepfake Verification**: In an age where misinformation can spread rapidly, FaceMosaic provides a crucial layer of authenticity. By comparing uploaded images with established identities, it helps users verify the legitimacy of content they encounter online, empowering them to discern fact from fabrication. This is especially vital in social media, where deepfakes can influence public opinion and trust. 🔍

- **User Engagement**: The project fosters interaction by inviting users to explore their celebrity matches, creating a unique blend of entertainment and awareness about digital authenticity. It’s not just about matching faces; it’s about encouraging critical thinking in the digital age. 💡

- **Social Media Impact**: As social media continues to grow, the need for verification tools becomes increasingly important. FaceMosaic plays a pivotal role in helping users navigate the complexities of online identities, promoting responsible sharing and consumption of content. 📱

## Folder Structure 📂

To successfully run the FaceMosaic project on Google Colab, please follow these steps to create the necessary folder structure:

1. **Create a Main Project Folder**: Name it `FaceMosaic` (or any name you prefer).

2. **Inside the Main Folder**, create two subfolders:
   - `dataset/`: This folder will store the celebrity images.
   - `Sample/`: This folder will contain the image you want to compare.

3. **Upload Images**:
   - Place your celebrity images (e.g., `celebrity1.jpg`, `celebrity2.jpg`) inside the `dataset/` folder.
   - Place the image you want to compare (e.g., `person1.jpg`) inside the `Sample/` folder.

The final folder structure should look like this:
